# MD-DDL Examples

This directory contains reference examples that demonstrate the MD-DDL
specification across increasing levels of complexity. Use these as
patterns when modelling your own domains.

## Examples

Example | Description | Complexity
--- | --- | ---
[Simple Customer](Simple%20Customer/domain.md) | Minimal 2-file example — one domain, three entities, one enum, one event | Starter
[Financial Crime](Financial%20Crime/domain.md) | Comprehensive AML/fraud domain — 15+ entities, sources, products, BIAN alignment | Intermediate
[Healthcare](Healthcare/domain.md) | FHIR-aligned clinical domain — 12 entities, HIPAA governance, knowledge-graph product | Intermediate
